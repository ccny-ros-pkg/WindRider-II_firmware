Getting started
===============

Before we dive into the description of the code flow there are some prerequisites we assume you are familiar with and thus will not be explained in this document:

 * C++ standard library programming experience.

 * STM32 Peripheral library. STM libraries are very well documented inside their header files. Feel free to navigate to link folder and take a closer look.

 * Unix command line.

 * CMake. Used as a build system. Not very crucial to modify the code.


Dependencies
============
Tools required to build and debug this firmware.
